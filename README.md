Guessing game for cf201 (contains index.html, about.html, app.js, this file, myfbpic.jpg)
A game in which a player guesses the answer to various questions about me, and is displayed feedback based on their answers.
The game checks the player's submissions against the recorded answers, some of which are generated randomly.
Here's a "joke":
Two people are conversing at a bar.
A: Your place or mine?
B: Both. You go to yours and I go to mine.
