  <p><h1>Here's what this script is doing:</h1></p>
  <p><h2>The initial prompt asks the player for their name and logging its value into the console.</h2></p>
  <p><h2>First, it's declaring a variable for the player's <font color="#FF0000">score</font>.</h2></p>
  <p><h2>Then, it gives the player a prompt involving a yes or no question.</h2></p>
  <p><li>The <font color= "#CC0000">toLowerCase()</font> function is used in case the player uses capitalization when inputting their answers.</li></p>
  <p><h2>The resulting lower-case string is assigned to a variable, which is then checked against the answer (either yes or no) for that question.</h2></p>
  <p><h2>If the answer is correct, the <font color="#FF0000">score</font> variable is increased by 1 and the script moves on to the next question.</h2></p>
  <p><li>(Otherwise, the script adds the question to the missed variable and moves on to the next question.)</li></p>
  <p><h2>The remaining questions are fired off, and their answers are checked.</h2></p>
  <p><h2>After all questions have been answered, an <font color= "#BBFFA2">alert</font> pops up displaying the player's final score.</h2></p>
  <p><li>The message at the end of the <font color= "#BBFFA2">alert</font> varies depending on how well the player did.</li></p>
  <p><h2>The page displays the player's final score where the text in the nukeit div was.</h2></p>

  <p align= "center">Hi! My name is Rob.<br>
    I currently design/manage <a href= "http://www.cardexchangegaming.com">the website</a> for a gaming store on Aurora. I also organize and run the store's events.<br>
  In my free time, I like weightlifting, going to metal concerts, and playing Magic: the Gathering.<br>
  Amaranthe is my favorite band.<br>
My boyfriend and I have been together 7 years. We're currently arguing over what kind of pet we want.<br>
...and no, I've never had regular Mountain Dew.</p>
