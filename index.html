  <h1>Let's Play a Game</h1>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
  Here's what this script is doing:
<p>
The initial prompt asks the player for their name and logging its value into the console.
<p>
First, it's declaring a variable for the player's score.
<p>
Then, it gives the player a prompt involving a yes or no question.
<p>
The toLowerCase() function is used in case the player uses capitalization when inputting their answers.
The resulting lower-case string is assigned to a variable, which is then checked against the answer (either yes or no) for that question.
<p>
If the answer is correct, the score variable is increased by 1 and the script moves on to the next question.
<br>
<i>(Otherwise, the script adds the question to the missed variable and moves on to the next question.)</i>
<p>
The remaining questions are fired off, and their answers are checked.
<p>
After all questions have been answered, the final score is displayed at the bottom.
