I went to UW and graduated with a BA in communication, which has proven ever so useful. /sarcasm<br>
I currently design/manage <a href= "http://www.cardexchangegaming.com">the website</a> for a gaming store on Aurora.
I also organize and run the store's events.<br>
In my free time, I like weightlifting, going to metal concerts, and playing Magic: the Gathering.<br>
Amaranthe is my favorite band. <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yimkRDcDpf4" target="_blank">Click here to listen!</a><br>
My boyfriend and I have been together 7 years. We're currently arguing over what kind of pet we want.</p>
